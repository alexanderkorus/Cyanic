 Component is the data model representation of the UICollectionViewCell rendered on the BaseComponentVC.
 A Component should be an immutable struct and it should contain UI specific characteristics related to the content
 that should be displayed in the ComponentCell.

 A Component is what is used to diff between two collections by RxDataSources.
